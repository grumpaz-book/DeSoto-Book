# ‚ö° Interlinked Archive Node

This project simulates a retro-futuristic relay console designed to display technical documents, operator logs, and narrative press fragments. Inspired by zero-fold telemetry protocols and relay uplink simulations, this static site prioritizes modular design, clean separation of content, and expandable architecture.

## üöÄ Features

- Typewriter-style animated boot line
- Dot animation simulating handshake delay
- Dynamically loaded boot sequence from JSON
- Retro terminal aesthetic (black background, green/amber text)
- Modular architecture for easy expansion

## üìú Boot Sequence Format

The `boot-sequence.json` file defines startup logs:

```json
{
  "lines": [
    "> NODE UPLINK VERIFIED",
    "> QET-ID :: 4E:8D:71:AC:F3:29 ‚Ä¢ CRC-PASS",
    "> ARCHIVE INDEX INITIALIZED"
  ]
}

Future expansions may support branching boot scenarios, randomized strings, or time-based seed IDs.
üõ†Ô∏è Development Notes
- Project uses vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- For local development, launch via Live Server (VS Code recommended)
- Avoid opening index.html via file:// as JSON fetches will fail due to browser security policies
üß∞ Suggested Improvements
- Move CSS and JS into /css/ and /js/ folders
- Add log reader from external logs.json
- Animate secondary boot messages with fading/staggered reveals
- Introduce pseudo-auth or uplink override UI for interactive storytelling
